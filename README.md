[InStoKiloGram](http://dev.moo-moo.ru:8123/) is an application (not yet, but the main idea is) for diet, ration and weight control. 

The application helps to maintain certain lifestyle, that the user wants to achieve: whether to gain, lose or retain the weight. Also, it helps to analyze the ration of a user: what he or she ate for a breakfast, lunch or dinner â€” so it can give recommendations on the diet. 

The application is social network of users, who seek for help and support from others in terms of their body improvement goals. They share the result of their work on their profiles pages, so it has facebook-like set of features.
